## BOUNTY20

### SET UP YOUR FILES

1. Create a new folder and name it bounty20.
2. Create a folder inside the bounty20 folder and call it **css**.
3. Create another folder inside the bounty20 folder and call it **images**.
4. Add the following image to your file by right-click on each one and choosing Save Image As from the context menu.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmeade11/FEWD/master/Class2/codealong/solution-bounty20/images/sandwich.jpg" width="50%" /><br />
5. Create an index.html in the bounty20 folder and add your HTML boilerplate. 

### STRUCTURING THE CONTENT

6. We'll be adding our basic sections to the page next.  Add a `header` tag (remember: this is different from head and heading tags), followed by a `main` tag, followed by a `footer` tag.
7. In the `header` add a nav tag and create an anchor tag for each of our links: Our Menu, Contact, Directions.  Leave the href for each empty for now.
8. Add a heading to the `main` section with the text Menu.

#### Menu Content
