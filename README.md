# FEWD

Welcome to the fun world of Front End Web Development!  This GitHub repository is where you'll find all of the class materials you'll need for the next 10 weeks we're together.  Before each class, I'll add a PDF version of the slides and any starter code or details you'll need for class that day.  At the conclusion of class, I'll add solutions for the labs that we worked through.  Additionally, I'll post details about your homework assignments at the beginning of the week.  If there are any updates related to the homework, you'll find them in the corresponding homework folder for that class.   

Also, check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/jmeade11/FEWD/wiki).  There are helpful articles and how tos about related topics, such as how to get the most out of your code editor and how to upload your projects to GitHub.

## How to Download Class Materials

There are two options to get the materials on this site: download a zip copy of the files each time you need them, or create a clone using GitHub Desktop which will sync the files each time.

### Clone with GitHub Desktop
