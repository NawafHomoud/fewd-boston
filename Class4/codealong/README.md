## CSS Layout Techniques

In this class, we'll learn how to layout our web pages using 3 different techniques:

1. Floats
2. Flexbox
3. Grid 

The objective is to reproduce the homework layout, which features a header that spans the page width, followed by a main content area that is 70% of the page width and an aside element that fits into the remaining 30%, followed by a footer that will also span the full page width.
