# Class 5 Materials

By now, you already have all of the knowledge to build a complete web page.  Class 5 will be adding to that knowledge with advanced CSS for positioning elements.  We'll also be using both pseudo classes and pseudo elements to build an image gallery with hover overlays.  For homework this week, we'll be building a skeleton of our Startup Matchmaker website that we'll revist over the next couple of classes to enhance it with new features.

Startup Matchmaker is a pretty advance website, but we'll build it little-by-little, so that you can see how real world web pages come together.  All that practice will certainly help you as you start thinking about your final projects.
