So, in case you didn't know, your grandma didn't actually make this recipe, it was altered from an Open Source Recipe found at "http://www.opensourcefood.com/people/Amanori/recipes/mamas-recipe-the-best-chocolate-chip-cookies" so let's make sure to give credit where credit is due and add a link to the text above that reads Open Source Recipe.

## LAB 2: CSS BASICS
Instructions:

Grandma wants her recipe looking good so let's add some styles:

1. We're going to make Grandma's cookies look better, so open the lab2 folder and use the starter index.html file.
2. Make the background for the html element the color moccasin.
3. Set the font for the page to 16px and sans-serif.
4. Add a solid, 15px wide, chocolate colored border around the body.
5. The body should also have its background set to oldlace and font color set to saddlebrown.

## LAB 3: MORE CSS
Instructions:

Grandma is pretty happy, but we can do better:

1. Grandma's recipe needs more work so open the the index.html and the styles.css files in the lab3 folder.
2. Style the link color as chocolate
3. The body needs 20px of space between the border and the text.
4. Change the h1 to 40px and center align it.
5. Select just the words: "MMMMMM COOKIES!!!!" in the Nutrition Information and make them bold
6. **BONUS** Can you make more of the html background-color show around the outside of the body border?
